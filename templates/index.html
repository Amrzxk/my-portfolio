        My name is Amr Zakariya and I'm an aspiring DevOps Engineer.
        I'm a Computer Science and AI student at Helwan University with
        a strong focus on AWS cloud technologies, DevOps, and security.
        I have experience in backend development using Python,
        building efficient and scalable applications.
        My skills include cloud architecture, automation,
        infrastructure as code, and secure system design.
        Through certifications and hands-on projects,
        Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of backend logic,
        API integrations, and cloud-native solutions.
        I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing systems,
        and continuously expanding my expertise in cloud computing.
